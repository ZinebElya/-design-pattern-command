# Understanding the Command Design Pattern

- The Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- In essence, it turns a request into a stand-alone object, making it easy to pass requests as arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, or support undoable operations.

##  Key Components:

1. ### Command Interface: 
    Defines a common interface for all concrete command classes. It typically includes an execute() method.
2. ### Concrete Command Classes: 
    Implement the Command interface and encapsulate specific actions or operations.
3. ### Invoker: 
    Holds and triggers commands. It does not need to know the specifics of the command but simply invokes their execute() methods.
4. ### Receiver: 
    Represents the object on which the command operates. It performs the actual work when the execute() method is called.



- The Command pattern decouples the sender (Invoker) of a request from the receiver (Receiver) and allows you to create a flexible and extensible system where new commands can be added without modifying existing code.
- It's especially useful for implementing features like undo/redo functionality, queuing requests, or implementing macro commands.
- In summary, the Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, making it a powerful tool for building flexible, maintainable, and extensible software systems.
